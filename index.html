        <h2 class="homepara">Cybersecurity is becoming more and more important everyday.  This is because almost everything now is done online.  The more technology grows, the higher the demand for cybersecurity positions becomes.
            Cybersecurity is basically protecting data, networks, programs and other information from unauthorized or unattended access, destruction or change.  A lot of cyber attacks occur on small to medium sized businesses because they are a lot
            more vulnerable.  This is because they may lack important secuirty measures making it very easy for attackers to break in and steal valuable information.  Whether you think it does or not, cybersercurity will be a very prevelant topic in everybody's lives
            coming into the future.

            My purpose for making this website is to document my journey in the cybersecurity field.  It could be used for many various things like creating random blog posts, keeping track on activities I have participated in, or even describing how my education is going so far.  I have seen a lot of people in CIT related field make a blog of some sort so that is why I decided to create one myself.  I think it will be fun keeping it updated while allowing myself to see how far I have come since I started it.
            Websites are not necessarily what I will be doing in my future career, but I have enjoyed learning how to create them from HTML code and hope to use the knowledge learned about websites in my future cybersecurity field.
