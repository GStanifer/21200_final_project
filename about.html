        <p>
            Welcome to my blog.  My name is Garrett Stanifer and I am a student at IUPUI studying cybersecurity.  I am a second year student at IUPUI, but a first year cybersecurity student.  The majority of my study takes place in the classroom but I do try to learn some things outside of class.  I do this with tools like TryHackMe and YouTube that I feel really help me master some basic knowledge.

        <h1>Why CyberSecurity?</h1>
        <p>
            After having a subpar year in the Mechanical Engineering major, I decided to change to cybersecurity.  I decided to pursue cybersecurity because I have always been good with computers and also really enjoy working with them.
            So far, I am having a much better time with this degree and feel like I am learning things I will actually use in my future career.  My plan is to still graduate on time, even with changing majors.  I will do this by either adding
            some extra classes each semester or by participating in summer classes offered.  I will continue to update this blog as my education continues.
